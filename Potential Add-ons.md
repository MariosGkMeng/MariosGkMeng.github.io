1. Integration of simple Machine Learning Algorithms that are able to recommend parameter choices based on previous simulations
2. Parameter explorer: be able to get all simulations based on parameter rules (e.g. "Display signal A of all simulations that have the same a1, a2 and a3 parameter values")
3. Migrate VBA source code to Python (apparently Python is now able to perform any VBA calculations!)
