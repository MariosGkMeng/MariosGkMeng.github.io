## Motivation
           

The main goals of this long-awaited tool are:

- To introduce human factors and aesthetics to simulation studies with platforms that do not come with lean and flexible post-processors in order to minimize errors, eye strain and gasps of tiredness associated with assessing, understanding and writing code for extended periods of time.
- To automate tasks related to simulation studies and simulation results organization and comparison.

It has been years since I wished to be able to

-  effortlessly navigate through numerous simulation results
	-  without having to search them with traditional and inefficient methods (such as folder searching, file searching, etc.)
	- without the need to manually write simulation logs by noting parameter variations by hand. For instance, say you need to investigate effects of parameters you set in a simulation. Imagine having to write “parameter1: 0 --> 1” by hand for every simulation and then having to write assessment on effect of that parameter change by hand every time!

- Minimize the strain in my eyes that is generated by going through code all day! No matter how much you like to code, a combination of asimplistic GUI with smart automations and coding only when necessary is so much more human-oriented than a command line (sorry command line fans).

Of course, if you happen to be working on an already developed software that offers an efficient and pleasing post-processor, you do not need this tool right now. But often you will need to work on projects in which you’ll need to develop scripts (or use someone else’s) that perform the calculations.

Why excel and VBA?

*“What?? VBA?? How are you still using this old-fashioned, limited programming language in 2021??”*

Ok, before you report me to the Gods of programming, don’t forget that as a user you most probably won’t need to open a single VBA script in the tool.

Since many years I needed to enrich my excel automation skills for a few projects until it became a frequent “weapon of choice”. I was astounded by the vastness of possibilities excel can offer, while making it easy to check large chunks of numbers in a clean way.

For me, excel IS, in a way, a programming language. It is not tailored to computationally intensive tasks and this is the reason that I opt to use it only for organizing files, work and make visualizations. Especially regarding visualizations, it is easy to connect simple function results with different colors and styles in excel, as well as with icons. For a person who knows how to program in VBA, excel can be transformed into an optimal user-specific GUI.

If you have never used excel in that way and are skeptical, trust me, it is worth the small effort to get yourself familiarized with some of its capabilities, at least for the scope of this tool. I tried to keep the need to modify VBA scripts to a minimum. You are, however, required to have knowledge on how to use excel without VBA.

In addition, I believe that one should prefer this tool from other means of creating apps, because coding in VBA and writing functions in excel is much easier than building web-based apps, or apps on languages such as C++ and Java. After all, this tool is meant to be used by simulation engineers, researchers and generally analyzers, not strictly by developers. It is, therefore, easier to manipulate code in an excel-based tool and tailor it to your needs, than a web-based Java app.

Last but not least, given the fact that VBA is a very old and widely used language, it is so easy to google-search solutions to problems and find more than one suggestion in various websites. The VBA community is very large and eager to provide help.

[[1]](#_ftnref1) There is a possibility to integrate Python, Javascript and C# to excel. It is in my TODO list for further development for this tool to migrate VBA to Python scripting.

           

## Modes of operation

There are two possible operation modes for which this tool works.

· **“Mode 1”** is the mode in which the tool connects to a simulator that is capable of text-parsing (usually a scripting environment that engineers use, like MATLAB, or Python). Check Figure below.

· “**Mode 2**” the one in which the simulator is unable to parse text files. That is usually a closed-source software that comes with a GUI. Check Figure below.
