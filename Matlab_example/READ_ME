This is a working example for MATLAB (Mode 1, in case your SIMULATOR is MATLAB). 
The system simulated here is a system of two 1st order nonlinear differential system with two variables.

You will have to add the parameters in the excel tool from scratch. You can use thw following as a starting point. 

c0 = 0.1335;
c1 = 2;
c2 = 4;
c3 = 2.3;
c4 = 6;
c5 = 1;
c6 = 2;
A0 = 0;
P0 = 0;
dp = 0.2;
da = 0.1;
dt = 0.1;
t_end = 25;
md_sol_track = "...\Matlab example\solution_tracker.txt";

The "runs_sim.m" script is the one that performs the calculations, i.e. the simulation.
